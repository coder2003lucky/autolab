# Camera configuration
# For Arducam C-mount LN046 manual focus lens with Raspberry Pi HQ Camera
camera:
  # IMPORTANT: The LN046 is a PHYSICAL manual focus lens
  # You must adjust focus by physically rotating the focus ring on the lens itself
  # The focus_distance setting below is for motorized focus lenses only (likely won't work for LN046)
  focus_distance: null  # Leave as null - LN046 uses physical focus ring adjustment
  # Image quality settings (these WILL help with blurriness)
  sharpness: 2.0  # Sharpness level (0.0-16.0, default 1.0) - higher = sharper but may increase noise
  jpeg_quality: 85  # JPEG compression quality (1-100, default 75) - higher = better quality but larger files

# Streaming
# Higher resolution for better quality (HQ Camera supports up to 4056x3040)
stream:
  preview_width: 1920  # px (increased for better quality)
  preview_height: 1080  # px (increased for better quality)
  preview_fps: 15  # fps (reduced slightly for higher resolution)

# Safety / operational
emergency_stop:
  gpio_pin: 27  # GPIO pin for emergency stop button
